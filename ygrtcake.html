    <p>This lemon yogurt cake is my ideal dessert. It's a breeze to make, and it's moist, tender, and full of zesty flavor. A simple glaze takes it over the top.

        <p>Here’s a little something to brighten up your week: an easy, zesty lemon yogurt cake recipe!</p>
        <p>This style of yogurt cake has its roots in France, and the beauty of it is its simplicity. The ingredient list is short and sweet, and you don’t need any special equipment to make it – a couple bowls, a loaf pan, a whisk. You’ll also need measuring cups to make this recipe, but – fun fact! – in France, home bakers might measure the cake ingredients in a yogurt container, making it even simpler still.</p>

            Lemon Yogurt Cake Recipe Ingredients
            Here’s what you’ll need to make this lemon yogurt cake recipe:
            <ul>
                <li>Lemons, of course! You’ll whisk lemon zest into the cake batter and use lemon juice to make the glaze. I also like to sprinkle more zest on top!</li>
                <li>Greek yogurt – <a href="https://amzn.to/37Irozm">Stonyfield Greek Yogurt</a> is my favorite brand to use in this cake. It has a looser consistency than some very thick Greek yogurts, but it’s creamier and tangier than regular plain yogurt.</li>
                <li>All-purpose flour – <a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/how-to-measure-flour/">Spoon and level it</a> to avoid packing too much into your measuring cup.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/almond-flour/">Almond flour</a> – It makes this yogurt cake extra-moist and tender.</li>
                <li>Baking powder and eggs – They help the cake puff up as it bakes.</li>
                <li>Extra-virgin olive oil – It add richness and gives the cake fruity depth of flavor.</li>
                <li>Cane sugar – It makes the cake lightly sweet.</li>
                <li>Vanilla extract – For warm depth of flavor.</li>
                <li>My quick <a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/lemon-glaze/">lemon glaze</a> – Make it by stirring together <a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/how-to-make-powdered-sugar/">powdered sugar</a> and lemon juice. So easy!</li>
                <li>And sea salt – To make all the flavors pop!</li>
            </ul>
